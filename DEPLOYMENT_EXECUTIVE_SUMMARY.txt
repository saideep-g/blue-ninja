  - Test daily mission generation
  - Test enrichment process
  - Verify hook integration
  ✓ Verification: All tests pass locally

PHASE 4: Analytics Validation (45 min)
  - Check Firebase Firestore documents
  - Verify v1 fields preserved
  - Verify v2 fields present
  - Validate dashboard still works
  ✓ Verification: Firestore has both v1 + v2 fields

PHASE 5: Production Deployment (30 min)
  - Merge PR #3 to main
  - Deploy to production
  - Monitor metrics for 24 hours
  - Confirm daily missions show 14 questions
  ✓ Verification: No errors, all functionality working

TOTAL TIME: 3-4 hours

================================================================================
  BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY GUARANTEES
================================================================================

✅ ALL v1 FIELDS PRESERVED
   questionId, atomId, studentAnswer, correctAnswer, isCorrect, timeSpent,
   speedRating, masteryBefore, masteryAfter, diagnosticTag, isRecovered,
   recoveryVelocity, timestamp

✅ ALL VALIDATION RULES INTACT
   - Type validation
   - Range validation (timeSpent: 0-300000ms)
   - Logical consistency checks
   - isCorrect matching logic
   - speedRating consistency
   - All original rules enforced

✅ ALL EXISTING HOOKS WORK
   - useDailyMission() - compatible (enrichment added internally)
   - useDiagnostic() - compatible (enrichment added internally)
   - analytics.trackEvent() - compatible (same API)
   - All dashboards - compatible (new fields optional)

✅ ZERO DATA LOSS
   - Enrichment is additive only
   - v1 fields never modified
   - Firestore documents never corrupted
   - Existing logs untouched
   - Full history preserved

✅ VALIDATION PHILOSOPHY
   V1 Validation: STRICT (must pass, or log rejected)
   V2 Validation: PERMISSIVE (can warn, log still saved)
   Result: Stricter than before, never loses data

================================================================================
  ANALYTICS ENRICHMENT (CRITICAL SERVICE)
================================================================================

WHAT HAPPENS:
  1. Student submits answer
  2. Create v1 log (existing process)
  3. Validate v1 fields (STRICT)
  4. Look up atom in v2 curriculum
  5. Enrich log with:
     - atomIdV2 (CBSE7.CH01.INT.01 format)
     - templateId (NUMERIC_INPUT, MCQ_CONCEPT, etc.)
     - moduleId (CBSE7-CH01-INTEGERS)
     - domain (Integers, Algebra, etc.)
     - masteryProfileId (MP_CORE_FLUENCY, etc.)
     - learningBehavior (FLUENCY, BUILDING, STRUGGLING, etc.)
     - outcomeIds (learning objectives)
     - And 10+ more optional fields
  6. Validate v2 fields (PERMISSIVE)
  7. Save enriched log to Firestore
  8. Continue with normal flow

WHY IT MATTERS:
  - Teachers get insights into what, not just accuracy
  - Parents see progress by chapter/module
  - Admins can analyze by template/domain/behavior
  - Students get personalized recovery
  - Platform learns optimal question sequencing

SAFETY:
  - v1 validation must pass (strict)
  - v2 enrichment optional (graceful fallback)
  - If curriculum lookup fails, log still saved
  - If enrichment fails, warning logged but continues
  - No breaking changes to any existing systems

================================================================================
